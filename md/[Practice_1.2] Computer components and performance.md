As mentioned above, the only limitation is the time it takes to send electionic signals from one edge of chip to the other. Because of the chip has disk-shaped, so, distance between 2 edges is diameter of a round chip. 

The chip has a clock rate of $1GHz$, so clock cycles is $1ns$ = $10^{-9}s$

Here, we can see the problem mentioned that electronic signals has the velocity is $300000 km/s$, so, the diameter of a round chip (or the travel distance between 2 edge, or the travel distance in $1ns$) is $s = v \times t = 300000 km/s \times 10^{-9}s = 0.0003 km = 300mm $ 

In the second case, the chip has a clock rate of $1THz = 10^{12}Hz $, so clock cycle is $10^{-12}s$, so, the diameter of a round chip (or the travel distance between 2 edge, or the travel distance in $1ns$) is $s = v \times t = 300000 km/s \times 10^{-12}s = 0.0000003 km = 0.3 mm $
